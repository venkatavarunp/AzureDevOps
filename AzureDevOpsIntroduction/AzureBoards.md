# Azure Boards
it's commonly used to learn how to manage work  

Backlog is a place where you organize work still to be done into an hierarchy of very abstract to pretty detailed work items.

high level backlog management is often called portfolio management and it is done by product managers or product owners.
## Work Item 
work item is used to refer to any piece of work that is noted down in actual words but what is a work item or if you are used to managing work using a physical board then every sticky note is a work item.

the first three epic, feature and user story are used on backlogs
### User Stories
user stories are the lowest type of work item and should be used to describe a single piece of work that woulddeliver value to end user.
### Feature 
Above an user story there can be a feature and feature is a more high level description of something that a product owner would like to see realized in his product and would consist of multiple user stories.
### Epics
finally features can optionally be carved into epics and epics are often used for long term portfolio management and road mapping.

**It is recommended to only add levels into  hierarchy when you need them so start by using only user stories and add features and other epics only when you need them**
### Sprints
user stories being their most concrete type of work are the work items that members of the development team will be actually developing and driving to done this is by adding the usage to race to an interaction often also called the Sprint where user story is detailed into a number of tasks which has to be performed to drive the item to done.

**in most cases epics and features are not added to iterations But are marked as done whenever all items are either done or removed**

Using different work item types to realte to an abstract level, not the amount of work required.

Work items are related using links, which are typed relationships.
